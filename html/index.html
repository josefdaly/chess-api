   <h2>Joe's Chess API</h2>
   <p>
     Welcome. The purpose of this app is to provide API endpoints for chess.
     At present I'm not sure what, if any, would be particularly useful. Right now,
     the relative route /next_best/ will take a string of moves and return a JSON
     containing an AI move, generated using the Stockfish Chess Engine.
   </p>
   <p>
     So for example, if you typed into your url bar
     "http://chess-api.herokuapp.com/next_best/a2a3e7e5e2e4", you might get a JSON
     containing the following:
   </p>
   <p>
     {"moves":["a2a3","e7e5","e2e4","b8c6"],"boardBefore":"  ABCDEFGH\n8 rnbqkbnr\n7
     pppp.ppp\n6 ........\n5 ....p...\n4 ....P...\n3 P.......\n2 .PPP.PPP\n1
     RNBQKBNR\n","bestNext":"b8c6"}
   </p>
   <p>
     bestNext is a string representation of the computer's response to the
     previous moves. In this case, it's Knight at b8 to c6.
   </p>
   <p>
     Moves is an array containing all of the game moves, including the computer's
     most recent move.
   </p>
   <p>
     boardBefore is a string representation of the game board before that move
     was made.
